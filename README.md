# Employee Churn Prediction & Retention Investment 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes employee data to predict churn (attrition) and provides data-driven recommendations for improving employee retention.  
By leveraging **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, the project aims to identify key factors influencing employee turnover and develop strategies to enhance job satisfaction.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Predict which employees are at risk of leaving the company.
- Analyze employee feedback to detect patterns (NLP).
- Provide actionable insights for HR to improve employee retention.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Random Forest
- **NLP**: spaCy, NLTK
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Model Evaluation**: ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix

## 📊 Dataset Information
The dataset contains employee-related information, including:
- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Education Level
- **Work Details**: Department, Salary, Promotion History, Job Satisfaction
- **Performance**: Performance Ratings, Work Hours, Bonuses
- **Attrition Status**: Whether an employee has left or stayed (Churn Indicator)

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning** – Handle missing values, feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understand key trends using visualization.
3. **Machine Learning Model Development** – Train models to predict employee churn.
4. **NLP for Employee Feedback Analysis** – Extract insights from textual feedback.
5. **Result Interpretation & Business Recommendations** – Provide insights for HR strategies.

## 📈 Expected Outcomes
- **Improved Employee Retention** – HR can take proactive steps based on insights.
- **Cost Reduction** – Reduce hiring and training costs due to high turnover.
- **Enhanced Workplace Culture** – Understand employee needs through data.
